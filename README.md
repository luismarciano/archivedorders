# archivedorders
Archived Orders in Magento


Still loads to do and improve. It contains a basic structure for creating an additional table that displays archived order data in Magento. It would be a useful building block for a more complete extension.

The use case of this extension would be when you don't want to go through the hassel of importing large amounts of orders from another Magento store or other ecommerce platform into the Magento order tables, but you still want the customer to be able to see this data in a flat table.




--------------

### Installing this extension
```
modman clone https://github.com/luismarciano/archivedorders.git
```

### System Configuration
A new section under the System -> Configuration -> Sales tab is added called â€œArchived Orders". In this section you can enable/disable configure the text messaging displayed.



### Database table format

There is a very generic flat table created by this extension that you can modify the structure of for your own custom data structure. To change the columns edit:
